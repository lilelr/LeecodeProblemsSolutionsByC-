// Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.
//
//Note:
//
//        Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: [2,2,3,2]
//Output: 3
//Example 2:
//
//Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
//Output: 99

////The usual bit manipulation code is bit hard to get and replicate. I like to think about the number in 32 bits and just count how many 1s are there in each bit, and sum %= 3 will clear it once it reaches 3. After running for all the numbers for each bit, if we have a 1, then that 1 belongs to the single number, we can simply move it back to its spot by doing ans |= sum << i;
//
//This has complexity of O(32n), which is essentially O(n) and very easy to think and implement. Plus, you get a general solution for any times of occurrence. Say all the numbers have 5 times, just do sum %= 5.
